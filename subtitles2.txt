In this lesson, we're going to be talking about finance. And___3400___6177
one of the most important aspects of finance is interest.___6177___10009
When I go to a bank or some other lending institution___10009___13655
to borrow money, the bank is happy to give me that money. But then I'm___13655___17720
going to be paying the bank for the privilege of using their money. And that___17900___21480
amount of money that I pay the bank is called interest. Likewise, if I put money___21660___26440
in a savings account or I purchase a certificate of deposit, the bank just___26620___31220
doesn't put my money in a little box and leave it there until later. They take___31300___35800
my money and lend it to someone else. So they are using my money.___35800___40822
The bank has to pay me for the privilege of using my money.___40822___44400
Now what makes banks profitable is the rate___44400___48700
that they charge people to use the bank's money is higher than the rate that they___48700___53330
pay people like me to use my money. The amount of interest that a person pays or___53510___60720
earns is dependent on three things. It's dependent on how much money is involved.___60800___66640
It's dependent upon the rate of interest being paid or the rate of interest being___66820___71300
charged. And it's also dependent upon how much time is involved. If I have___71480___77898
a loan and I want to decrease the amount of interest that I'm going to pay, then___77898___82730
I'm either going to have to decrease how much money I borrow, I'm going to have___82800___88040
to borrow the money over a shorter period of time, or I'm going to have to find a___88220___92420
lending institution that charges a lower interest rate. On the other hand, if I___92600___97279
want to earn more interest on my investment, I'm going to have to invest___97279___101480
more money, leave the money in the account for a longer period of time, or___101480___106860
find an institution that will pay me a higher interest rate.___106860___109970
